# Free-news-IPTV
Free news IPTV : The name says it all its free news IPTV this is just for android tv live channels , if you would like to make the app contents bigger you can suggest and contribute with ideas and share url streams for me to add to the playlist , can create nice logos for the app etc . This repo is only for people to help with ideas and requests thank you .

I collect free and legal streams from various places on the net then compile them into a playlist for my App to play via the Live Channels 
(credits to everyone up there that collect free streams and reshare them THANK YOU ).


HOW DOES THE APP WORK 

After you download the APP you can open it from the playstore or by clicking on the icon to get started if that fails due to having a lower end device Please launch it from the Live channels Sources .

Then scan for the channels currently only have 24 channels but will make it big aiming for 100 don't want too much .
Once the channels are ready you should also have a Tv guide for the programs ,I use a free service on there so sometimes the guide won't populate as i have to do them manually when i have time :) .

Link to the playstore for the app if you have an android tv device :
